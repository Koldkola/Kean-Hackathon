User interface blueprint: When opening up the website you will be prompted to enter the city, state and zip code of your location. Once you enter your location the left side will show the city you are living in as well as the poor air quality surrounding and on the right you’ll be asked to enter your address and be advised the areas to not go for the sake of enjoying a family picnic, jogging/exercising, meditating, and spend time with friends. If you don’t like it then you will be given another option until you find what's right for you.
